In this short post I want to share a simple tripod stand for devices with standarised 1/2" camera nut. It has ball joint which can be fixed with two m3 bolts and nuts.

I printed it with PLA material on the Ender 3 printer. For the ball it is good to print it with 0.12 mm layer height and 60% infill - makes the thread stronger. The rest parts are ok with 0.2 layer height and smaller infill.
