<div style="text-align: justify"> R - 2R is one of the simpliest way to perform digital to analog conversion. In combination with Arduino,
which lacks a build-in DAC, it seems to be a good thing. Let's make a simple example with this type of DAC using Citron Maker UNO.  </div>

Firstly, I made a circuit on breadboard, checked if everything is working and so on, but now I will show and discuss the schematic
