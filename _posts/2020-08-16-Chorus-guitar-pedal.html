excerpt: Guitar with chorus defines pure tone of 80's music. Every guitarist who loves 80's rock music needs to have a chorus pedal in his board. But instead buiyng chorus, it's better to

<p align="justify">I've built chorus based on BOSS CE-2 schematic as it's widely accessible on the internet and, what can I say, it's probably most iconic chorus pedal.
I have put to use a schematic at BYOC (<a href="http://byocelectronics.com/analogchorusschematic.pdf">link</a>) which gets rid of boss FET switching, add led rate indicator and
change MN3007, MN3101 to MN3207, MN3102. BOSS CE-2 is nicely analysed <a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/boss-ce-2-analysis">here</a> </p>

<p align="justify">I've designed pcb board for this pedal in EAGLE. Ordered 5 pcbs for 7$ at JLCpcb. When pcb arrived it was time to solder everything up, prepare enclosure,
assemble and play</p>

<p align="justify">I have made anclosure on my own, designed in Inventor and then 3d printed. 3d printed enclosures are great equivalent to the metal ones, but need to remember
is to put copper tape int enclosure to prevent EM noise</p>
