<p>I'm currently a student of Mechatronics at WUT. My hobbies are: music, guitars,
  electronics, mechanics and automotive. I love DIY and I'm always looking for the opportunity to do something myself.
On this blog I'm going to post some of my projects containing DIY guitar pedals, 3d print works and many more!</p>
